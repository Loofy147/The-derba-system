## Todo List for TuberOrchestratorAI Improvements

### Phase 2: Analyze code structure and organization
- [x] Review `tuber_core.py` for potential optimizations in graph operations.
- [x] Examine `tuber_orchestrator.py` for clarity and modularity of main logic.
- [x] Assess `llm_interface.py` for robustness and error handling.
- [x] Check `config.py` for comprehensive and well-documented settings.
- [x] Evaluate `challenge_agent.py` for extensibility of exploration strategies.
- [x] Review `meta_cognitive.py`, `question_generator.py`, `question_classifier.py` for integration and functionality.

### Phase 3: Identify improvement opportunities
- [x] Detail specific refactoring tasks for each module.
- [x] Outline enhancements for LLM interaction and cost management.
- [x] Propose improvements for the reward and self-reflection mechanisms.
- [x] Suggest new features or capabilities based on initial analysis.

### Phase 4: Implement structural improvements and refactoring
- [ ] Execute refactoring tasks.
- [ ] Implement identified enhancements.
- [ ] Add new features as planned.

### Phase 5: Continue with specialized knowledge integration plan
- [ ] Begin implementing the `DataIngestionModule`.
- [ ] Define `TuberNode` structure for specialized knowledge.
- [ ] Develop mechanisms for learning from code patterns.
- [ ] Integrate research review capabilities.
